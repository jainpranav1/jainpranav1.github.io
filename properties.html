      <h1>Properties</h1>
      <p>
        Properties are a deceptively simple concept. Understanding properties
        can help with understanding features in machine learning. In this
        article, I would like to go through the different ways I have thought
        about properties.
      </p>
      <h2>Table Perspective</h2>
      <p>
        One way to think about properties are as column headers. Consider a
        table of data:
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Height (inches)</th>
          <th>Weight (pounds)</th>
          <th>Age (years)</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>65</td>
          <td>150</td>
          <td>25</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>70</td>
          <td>180</td>
          <td>30</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>68</td>
          <td>160</td>
          <td>28</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>
        The "properties" here are the column headers. In particular, they are
        the words themselves and nothing else (later we will discuss
        perspectives where a property is more than just some text on a page). In
        machine learning, we can define properties whose data is used as input
        to an ML model as "features". The properties whose data is used as
        output can be defined as "targets".
      </p>

      <p>
        Properties are generally descriptive enough that one can understand the
        meaning of the data in their column. However, one can use have
        non-descriptive properties, as exemplified below. The meaning of the
        data will have to be explained separately.
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>A</th>
          <th>B</th>
          <th>C</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>65</td>
          <td>150</td>
          <td>25</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>70</td>
          <td>180</td>
          <td>30</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>68</td>
          <td>160</td>
          <td>28</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h2>Function Perspective</h2>

      <p>
        Another way to think about properties are as a function. A function is
        just an assignment between two sets where each element of the first set
        is assigned to exactly one element in the second set. An example of the
        property "height" is shown below. Height maps elements from the set
        "People" to the set "Heights".
      </p>
      <pre class="mermaid">
            flowchart LR
                subgraph people ["People"]
                  mary[Mary]
                  john[John]
                  matthew[Matthew]
                end

                subgraph heights ["Heights"]
                  65in[65 inches]
                  68in[68 inches]
                  70in[70 inches]
                end

                mary --> 65in
                john --> 65in
                matthew --> 70in
      </pre>

      <p>
        In Machine Learning, we can define features as those properties whose
        outputs are used as inputs to an ML model. Targets are those properties
        whose outputs are used as outputs of an ML model.
      </p>
      <p>
        This way of thinking about properties is pretty similar to the way that
        a random variable is thought about in probability theory.
