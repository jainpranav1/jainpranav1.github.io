      <h1>Features</h1>
      <p>
        Features are a deceptively simple concept in machine learning. In this
        article, I would like to go through the different ways I have thought
        about features.
      </p>
      <h2>Table Perspective</h2>
      <p>
        One way to think about features are as column headers. Consider a table
        of data:
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Height (inches)</th>
          <th>Weight (pounds)</th>
          <th>Age (years)</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>65</td>
          <td>150</td>
          <td>25</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>70</td>
          <td>180</td>
          <td>30</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>68</td>
          <td>160</td>
          <td>28</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>
        The "features" here are the column headers. In particular, they are the
        words themselves and nothing else (later we will discuss perspectives
        where a feature is more than just some text on a page).
      </p>

      <p>
        Features are generally descriptive enough that one can understand the
        meaning of the data in their column. However, one can use have
        non-descriptive features, as exemplified below. The meaning of the data
        will have to be explained separately.
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>A</th>
          <th>B</th>
          <th>C</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>65</td>
          <td>150</td>
          <td>25</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>70</td>
          <td>180</td>
          <td>30</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>68</td>
          <td>160</td>
          <td>28</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
