    <h1>Properties</h1>
    <p>
      Properties are a deceptively simple concept. Understanding properties
      can help with understanding features in machine learning. In this
      article, I would like to go through the different ways I have thought
      about properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      One fascinating thing I have noticed about properties is that when discussing
      properties with people while focused on a specific domain, properties feel so
      natural that they don't need explaining - we just bring them up and use them.
      For example when discussing with my father (a physician) about cancer, we talked
      about the property of "tumor size" very naturally. Only when I am studying ML on
      my own do questions arise about what properties really are. I think it stems from
      the fact that in ML, we think about properties (really features and targets) in a more
      abstract way divorced from any specific domain.
    </p>

    <h2>Table Perspective</h2>
    <p>
      One way to think about properties are as column headers. Consider a
      table of data:
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Height (inches)</th>
        <th>Weight (pounds)</th>
        <th>Age (years)</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>65</td>
        <td>150</td>
        <td>25</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>70</td>
        <td>180</td>
        <td>30</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>68</td>
        <td>160</td>
        <td>28</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      The "properties" here are the column headers. In particular, they are
      the words themselves and nothing else (later we will discuss
      perspectives where a property is more than just some text on a page). In
      machine learning, we can define properties whose data is used as input
      to an ML model as "features". The properties whose data is used as
      output can be defined as "targets".
    </p>

    <p>
      Properties are generally descriptive enough that one can understand the
      meaning of the data in their column. However, one can use have
      non-descriptive properties, as exemplified below. The meaning of the
      data will have to be explained separately.
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>A</th>
        <th>B</th>
        <th>C</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>65</td>
        <td>150</td>
        <td>25</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>70</td>
        <td>180</td>
        <td>30</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>68</td>
        <td>160</td>
        <td>28</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Function Perspective</h2>

    <p>
      Another way to think about properties are as a function. A function is
      just an assignment between two sets where each element of the first set
      is assigned to exactly one element in the second set. An example of the
      property "height" is shown below. Height maps elements from the set
      "People" to the set "Heights".
    </p>
    <pre class="mermaid">
            flowchart LR
                subgraph people ["People"]
                  mary[Mary]
                  john[John]
                  matthew[Matthew]
                end

                subgraph heights ["Heights"]
                  65in[65 inches]
                  68in[68 inches]
                  70in[70 inches]
                end

                mary --> 65in
                john --> 65in
                matthew --> 70in
      </pre>

    <p>
      In Machine Learning, we can define features as those properties whose
      outputs are used as inputs to an ML model. Targets are those properties
      whose outputs are used as outputs of an ML model.
    </p>
    <p>
      This way of thinking about properties is pretty similar to the way that
      a random variable is thought about in probability theory.
    </p>
  </div>


  <h2>Axis Perspective</h2>

  <p>
    Another way to think of properties are as axes in a coordinate system.
    Say you have a 3d coordinate system. You can think of the x-axis as the
    property "height", the y-axis as the property "weight", and the z-axis
    as the property "age". In this perspective, each person is represented
    as a point in the 3d space.
  </p>


  <h2>Instantiation Perspective</h2>

  <p>
    Another way to think about properties are that they are a mental concept
    that can be instantiated. For example, consider the property "height".
    Height is a concept. Instances of "height" are specific heights like 64 inches,
    70 inches, etc. Note that the term "height" is being used as a common noun and
    proper noun here. I think that this perspective is more abstract, yet it is the
    one closest to what is used in everyday life.
  </p>


  <h2>Abstraction Perspective</h2>

  <p>
    I came up with another way of thinking about properties after chatting
    with copilot. This perspective is quite layered, so I will share with
    a story.
  </p>
  <p>
    We start with a group of early humans.
    These early humans receive a barrage of sensory input - colors, textures,
    tastes, sounds. The picture below (a snippet of a QR code) visually represents
    this idea.
  </p>
  <img src="/properties/images/qrCode.png" id="qrCode" />
  <p>
    The human mind automatically draws dividing lines within this sensory input.
    Rather than experiencing unbearable sensory input, these humans experience
    trees, rocks, animals. We refer to the results of taking the sensory input and
    drawing clear boundary lines as "objects". Objects are basically groups of sensory input.
    Look around the room you are currently
    in! You, like the early human, will automatically start to see a chair, TV, a backpack.
    However, if you look at your wall, you may not see any clear boundary - more like white
    noise. What is within each of the boundaries is an object.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nothing stops humans from creating new objects. Looking at your wall, you can group
    several bumps close to one another and construct an object. Also, humans can experience
    more than just sensory input. They are capable of mental experience as well. We will expand
    the definition of "objects" to include groups of mental experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    The early humans recognize that
    many of the objects they experience in the world around them
    are quite similar to another. Many of the apples give
    them a similar experience to the following square:
  </p>
  <div id="redSquare"></div>
  <p>
    Other apples provide a similar experience to the
    following square:
  </p>
    <div id="greenSquare"></div>
  <p>
    The humans abstract the similarity into its own object
    (a mental one in this case). One object is labelled as red.
    One is labelled as green. We can call these abstractions of similar
    objects as "abstracts".
  </p>
  <p>
    The early humans also notice that many of these abstracts are similar to one another.
    Red, blue, green, orange, etc. all are visual mental experiences. The early humans
    group them together and call the group "color".
  </p>
  <p>
    We define a group of similar abstracts as an "abstract group".
    For each object, we can look
    through many abstract groups and find suitable abstracts for the object. For example,
    for an apple, we can look through "color" and find "red". We can look through weight
    and find "light".
  </p>
  <p>
    Building on this, one could make a machine that takes in an object into an input slot,
    processed the object, and outputs an abstract of an abstract group into an output slot.
    We call this machine an abstract machine.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, after all that 😅, what is a property? One way to think about a property is as
    an abstract group. This is probably the most intutive way of thinking.
    The values of that property are then abstracts. Another way
    to think about a property is as an abstract machine. This is similar to how we think
    about random variables in probability theory.
    Lastly, a way to think about a
    property is as the output slot of an abstract machine. This is a great way of thinking about
    properties that captures the idea that properties change from object to object (the value the
    property is holding changes). This seems like a great way to think about "variables".
