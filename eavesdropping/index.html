      <p>
        In this video game, you play as Eve—a brilliant cryptographer once
        trusted with safeguarding federal secrets. Tasked with securing
        sensitive communications, she uncovered a darker reality: criminal
        syndicates were masking their operations behind ciphers and encoded
        messages. But when she sounded the alarm, the government chose silence.
        Outraged and unwilling to let corruption flourish, Eve vanished from her
        post and reemerged as a rogue vigilante. Armed with nothing but her
        intellect and a custom toolkit, she now intercepts underground
        transmissions, decodes their secrets, and rewrites their contents to pit
        crime bosses against one another. She doesn’t just break codes—she
        breaks empires.
