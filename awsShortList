      <h1>AWS Short List</h1>
      <p>
        As I have been studying AWS, I wanted to create a short summary on each
        AWS concept that I have learned. Here is a collection of those
        summaries.
      </p>
      <div id="awsConcepts">
        <sl-details summary="Snow Family">
          AWS provides physical devices for migrating large amounts of data and
          performing local compute in areas with limited internet access.
          Members of the snow family include Snowcone, Snowball, and Snowmobile.
        </sl-details>
        <sl-details summary="FSx">
          FSx enables users to run third party file systems, such as Windows
          File Server and Lustre, as a managed AWS service.
        </sl-details>
        <sl-details summary="Storage Gateway">
          Storage gateways create a bridge between an on-premise datacenter and
          S3-based storage. The gateway comes in a file based, block based
          (volume), and tape based flavor.
        </sl-details>
        <sl-details summary="Transfer">
          AWS Transfer provides a service for transferring files in and out of
          S3 and EFS using protocols such as SFTP, FTPS, and FTP.
        </sl-details>
        <sl-details summary="Data Sync">
          Data Sync is a service for transferring massive amounts of data
          between AWS services or between AWS and on-premise. Services supported
          include S3, EFS, and FSx.
